## About The Project

### Overview
Process Manufacturing is a robust tool tailored for businesses and organizations that need advanced manufacturing process management. Unlike traditional manufacturing solutions that rely on Item BoMs and subassemblies, our tool supports intricate processes involving multiple input and output items, giving you the control and flexibility you need to optimize your operations.

### Key Features
- Configure manufacturing process specifications. 
- Capture actual input/output/scrap quantities.
- Implement joint production costing methods: Physical measurement method & relative sales value method.

### Built With
